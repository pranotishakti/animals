<p align = "center"><font size ="6"><font color = "blue">Animal, (kingdom Animalia), any of a group of multicellular eukaryotic organisms <br/>
(i.e., as distinct from bacteria, their deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is contained in a membrane-bound nucleus).<br/>
 They are thought to have evolved independently from the unicellular eukaryotes.<br/>
 Animals differ from members of the two other kingdoms of multicellular eukaryotes, the plants (Plantae) and the fungi (Mycota), in fundamental variations in morphology and physiology. <br/>
This is largely because animals have developed muscles and hence mobility, a characteristic that has stimulated the further development of tissues and organ systems.</p></font>
